              <p>The H-Type Nubian yacht was a sleek luxury yacht and what it lacked in weapons it made up for in style and a strong deflector shield. The signature silver finish is a mark that the ship belongs to a former member of Naboo’s monarchy. Padme Amidala used a ship like this after her J-Type diplomatic barge was destroyed in an assassins attack. It was an H-Type that whisked Padme and Anakin Skywalker from Naboo to Tatooine, and then to Geonosis where the Clone Wars would begin.</p>

              <p>A massive and experimental craft, the Imperial Interdictor was equipped with a gravity well. It could pull other ships out of hyperspace, making it a dangerous tool for the Empire. One of its first catches was a rebel ship carrying Commander Sato and Ezra Bridger, and Admiral Brom Titus of the Interdictor quickly placed them under arrest. When Rex, Kanan, and Chopper came to rescue them, the rebels would turn out to be more than Titus bargained for. Chopper rigged the gravity weapon to malfunction; when the rebels escaped and the Interdictor tried to draw them in, it also pulled in other large Imperial ships. The Interdictor was destroyed, and the rebels returned home.</p>

              <p>The wedge-shaped Imperial Star Destroyer is a capital ship bristling with weapons emplacements. Turbolasers and tractor beam projectors dot its surface. Its belly hangar bay can launch TIE fighters, boarding craft, land assault units, hyperspace probes, or be used to hold captured craft. In the days of the Empire, its bustling bridge would be staffed by the finest crewers in the Imperial starfleet. Its presence in a system mark matters of extreme Imperial import. Though, as is typical of the Empire, not even the Star Destroyer was enough to sate the Imperial hunger for displays of power. Larger vessels, such as the Super Star Destroyer, dwarf even these giants.</p>

              <p>The Naboo Royal Starship boasts a strikingly beautiful design that embodies the craftsmanship that prevailed in the peaceful years of the Republic. The polished, streamlined J-type 327 Nubian vessel lacks any offensive weaponry, but does feature strong shields and a competent hyperdrive. During the Trade Federation invasion of Naboo, Queen Amidala and her retinue escaped aboard the Royal Starship. Piloted by Ric Olie, the vessel narrowly avoided the Trade Federation blockade, though its hyperdrive was damaged. The ship limped to Tatooine, where a replacement T-14 hyperdrive generator was procured.</p>

              <p>The Republic attack cruiser was not primarily a cargo transport, troop carrier or other replenishment or supply vessel; it was developed and honed for ship-to-ship combat. Its huge armored shape had an aggressive, dagger-like profile, studded with heavy weapons emplacements capable of punching through powerful shields and sturdy armor. The front half of the ship's spine contained a massive flight deck capable of scrambling the latest in Republic starfighters. The huge hangar doors opened to allow ships to land or takeoff from the deck; the vessel also had a smaller docking bay entrance on its lower side.</p>

              <p>Named for a legendary Mon Calamari commander from the early days of the Rebel Alliance, the Raddus served as Leia Organa’s mobile headquarters and flagship of the ragtag Resistance task force fleeing D’Qar. The MC85 Star Cruiser’s experimental deflector shields could withstand massive damage before failing. That innovation proved critical when Vice Admiral Holdo jumped the cruiser to hyperspace through a First Order task force. The Raddus was destroyed, but its sacrifice bought the Resistance time to escape to Crait.</p>

              <p>The TIE fighter was the unforgettable symbol of the Imperial fleet. Carried aboard Star Destroyers and battle stations, TIE fighters were single-pilot vehicles designed for fast-paced dogfights with Rebel X-wings and other starfighters. The iconic TIE fighter led to other models in the TIE family including the dagger-shaped TIE Interceptor and the explosive-laden TIE bomber. The terrifying roar of a TIE's engines would strike fear into the hearts of all enemies of the Empire.</p>

              <p>The X-wing is a versatile Rebel Alliance starfighter that balances speed with firepower. Armed with four laser cannons and two proton torpedo launchers, the X-wing can take on anything the Empire throws at it. Nimble engines give the X-wing an edge during dogfights, and it can make long-range jumps with its hyperdrive and its astromech droid co-pilot. Luke Skywalker is famous for destroying the Death Star behind the controls of an X-wing.</p>
